Detecting and Feature Extraction of Ovarian Cyst  
# The Start
Initially to start working, I'm trying out a few of segmentation using openCv from learnopency.com

# Segmentation
* Segmentation is the process of extracting the features/information on a image. There may be a lot of features in an image excluding the background .But, We're only focused on the details we actually want.

* One Such strategy we follow to only consider the details is to make use of the statistical methods such as mean/median/variance/std. deviation .
   In this basic segmentation ,I used mean as the threshold and I set the pixels of each of the image to either 0/1 depending on the threshold level set.
